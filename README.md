# php-euler
A simple repository containing PHP (generally) scripts to work with solving puzzles from Project Euler. These are provided for reference material, and to help with idea creation, instead of simply giving the solution!

## requirements
A basic PHP setup is required.

## running
Each problem has its own script, that may require specific input from other files. A script can be run directly as-is, provided the current environment is set-up correctly.
